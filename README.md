# About this prototype
This prototype is meant to simulate the character object and its physics interaction.

A state machine is implemented to organise different states of the character
behavior, which includes:

1. Idle

2. Jump

3. Fall

4. Run

5. Attack (TODO)

6. Dodge (TODO)

7. Double jump (TODO)

8. Hurt (TODO)

9. Death (TODO)

# Known issues
1. Running into a wall is causing jittering

# Future todo lists
1. Add more states
